# Architecture boundary

## What is deployed now

VoidChainApp is a multi-tenant EVM application runtime on **Robinhood Chain
testnet**. The parent chain has one real RPC endpoint and one EIP-155 chain ID:
`46630`.

```text
wallet or relayer
        |
        v
Robinhood Chain testnet (46630)
        |
        +--> VoidPaymaster (optional signed sponsorship)
        |
        v
VoidChainAppRuntime + tokenId
        |                    |
        |                    +--> toll and revenue accounting for that deed
        v
application registered for that same tokenId
```

The Runtime rejects an app address not registered for the given `tokenId`. It
also exposes the currently executing token and caller to the application, so
each app can preserve the tenant boundary. The deed holder's authority is read
from the ERC-721 at call time. A transfer therefore changes configuration
authority without granting the holder custody of third-party app assets.

`runtime ID` in VoidScan is a deterministic per-deed identifier retained for
the collection's internal namespace and possible future migration. It is not a
live EIP-155 network ID, and a wallet must not be asked to add it as an RPC
network.

## Safety boundaries

The present design provides application-level isolation, not protocol-level
isolation. A fault in the parent chain, runtime code, shared paymaster, shared
oracle or common indexer can affect more than one deed. An owner cannot rewrite
parent-chain history, seize a publisher's app balance through the runtime, or
turn a published app into a private contract merely by transferring the deed.

The per-deed DAO is deliberately narrow: it only votes on the maximum toll the
holder may set. It does not control withdrawals, arbitrary app calls, the deed,
the paymaster or the parent-chain contracts. Proposal and vote weight are
locked ERC-20 VOID, recovered only after the proposal deadline. This removes
the unverified off-chain Merkle-root voting model.

## What a real independent chain would require

Promotion from this runtime to a rollup is a new protocol project. At minimum it
needs a supported rollup stack on the chosen parent, sequencer and batch
submission operations, data availability and finality rules, a node/RPC service,
block explorer/indexer, bridge and canonical asset rules, EIP-155 chain ID,
native-gas policy, incident response, monitoring and a new audit scope.

The NFT may remain the economic and configuration deed through that migration,
but no current contract makes that migration automatic. Calling the current
runtime a separate L2/L3 would hide those requirements and is incorrect.
